Into this crashed death--Percival's.  
"Which is happiness?" I said (our child had been born), "which pain?" referring to the two sides of my body, as I came downstairs, making a purely physical statement.  
Also I made note of the state of the house; the curtain blowing; the cook singing; the wardrobe showing through the half- opened door.  
I said, "Give him (myself) another moment's respite" as I went downstairs.  
"Now in this drawing-room he is going to suffer.  
There is no escape."  
But for pain words are lacking. 
There should be cries, cracks, fissures, whiteness passing over chintz covers, interference with the sense of time, of space; the sense also of extreme fixity in passing objects; and sounds very remote and then very close; flesh being gashed and blood spurting, a joint suddenly twisted--beneath all of which appears something very important, yet remote, to be just held in solitude.  
So I went out.  
I saw the first morning he would never see--the sparrows were like toys dangled from a string by a child.  
To see things without attachment, from the outside, and to realize their beauty in itself--how strange!  
And then the sense that a burden has been removed; pretence and make-believe and unreality are gone, and lightness has come with a kind of transparency, making oneself invisible and things seen through as one walks--how strange.  
"And now what other discovery will there be?" I said, and in order to hold it tight ignored newspaper placards and went and looked at pictures.  
Madonnas and pillars, arches and orange trees, still as on the first day of creation, but acquainted with grief, there they hung, and I gazed at them.  
"Here," I said, "we are together without interruption."
